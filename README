# HOW TO USE THIS SCRAPER

1. Get a link to the nekomeru chapter (example: https://ciao.shogakukan.co.jp/comics/title/00511/episode/9255)

2. Open this folder with any code-editing software. Visual Studio Code is a lightweight option if you do not have one already.

4. Open a terminal and type the following into the command line: `npm install`. This will install everything this scraper needs to work.

5. Type the following into the command line: `node nekomeruscrape.js [URL]`, where `[URL]` is the chapter URL.

6. The scraper will get your images and write them to this folder in about 15 seconds or so. 

# USAGE

Command: `node nekomeruscrape.js [URL] [(optional) timeout] [(optional headless)]`

# OPTIONS

**timeout**
The command waits after images selectors begin loading to attempt scraping. The minimum/default wait time is 5 seconds.
You can change this value by adding a number (in seconds) to the end of the command. for example, the following will
wait 7.5 seconds instead of 5 before scraping:

`node nekomeruscrape.js [URL] 7.5`

This is done to ensure all images have loaded before scraping begins. If your computer is slow or your internet
connection is choppy, consider using a higher timeout time to compensate.

**headless**
By default, the scraper uses a headless browser to get images; that is, it does not visually render the browser while it operates.
You can manually change this value by adding "false" at the end of the command line.
*NOTE:* you must also enter a timeout value when using this command.

example:
`node nekomeruscrape.js [URL] 5 false`
